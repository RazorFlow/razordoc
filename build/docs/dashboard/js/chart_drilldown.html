        <p>Drill-downs allow your users to explore data by clicking on one item in your chart to reveal more data about the item that they have selected. For example, a drill-down might allow you to drill from Country-wide data to seeing data for an individual state. Drill-downs can also be used for navigating time-based records like drilling down from yearly data to monthly data.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s consider an example, where we&#39;re drilling from <em>Country</em> to <em>State</em> to <em>City</em>. We initially start off showing the <em>Country</em>-wide data, and once the user clicks on one country, it activates the next <strong>drill step</strong> which shows the states. Once the user clicks on the name of any sate, it activates a <strong>drill step</strong> which shows the cities in that state. Note that you would normally have to do a bit of filtering and aggregation but we will not be covering that here.</p>
<p>The basic concept here is to use the <code>addDrillStep</code> function to add one drill step at a time. Let&#39;s consider this basic skeleton of a chart:</p>
<pre><code>var chart = new ChartComponent ();
chart.setCaption (&quot;Sales by country&quot;);
chart.setLabels ([ /* list of countries */]);
chart.addSeries (&quot;sales&quot;, &quot;Sales&quot;, [ /* country-wise sales */]);

chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    alert (&quot;Filtering states for country: &quot; + params.label);
    chart.setLabels ([ /* List of states in the selected country */])
    chart.addSeries (&quot;sales&quot;, &quot;Sales&quot;, [ /* state-wise sales */])

    done (); // This is required
});

chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    alert (&quot;Filtering states for state: &quot; + params.label);
    chart.setLabels ([ /* List of cities in the selected state */])
    chart.addSeries (&quot;sales&quot;, &quot;Sales&quot;, [ /* city-wise sales */])

    done (); // This is required
});
</code></pre><h4 id="concept-1-your-chart-data-gets-reset-after-every-drill-step">Concept 1: Your chart data gets reset after every drill step</h4>
<p>Notice that though you called <code>addSeries</code> every time in the drill step, it didn&#39;t add a new series, but rather replaced it. Technically, operating on a chart after a drill step is like working on a new chart object.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong> When you are drilling down the chart, you normally show new data, with completely new labels and charts. This is similar to calling the <a href="/docs/dashboard/js/api/ChartComponent.html#clearChart">clearChart</a> function.</p>
<h4 id="concept-2-you-have-to-create-a-callback-to-handle-the-drill">Concept 2: You have to create a callback to handle the drill</h4>
<p>Since the code to perform the drill down has to be done after the user clicks on a chart item, it needs to be specified as a JavaScript callback.</p>
<h4 id="concept-3-you-have-to-call-done-at-the-end">Concept 3: You have to call &quot;done&quot; at the end</h4>
<p>Notice that there&#39;s a call to a function called <code>done</code> at the end of both drill step functions. This <code>done</code> function is also passed as the first parameter on the callback function.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this here?</strong> If you have to perform some asynchronous functionality like fetching data using AJAX, you can call <code>done</code> only after the data is available, and the chart is ready for display.</p>
<h4 id="concept-4-the-params-include-everything-from-onitemclick">Concept 4: The params include everything from onItemClick</h4>
<p>The parameters of the item that was clicked on by the user are provided. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>value</strong>: The value of the item that was clicked (purely numeric, this will not contain formatted values like number prefix/suffix, etc)</li>
<li><strong>label</strong>: The x-axis label that corresponds to the item that was clicked.</li>
<li><strong>labelIndex</strong>: The index of the label (starting from 0) that corresponds to the item that was clicked.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    $.ajax({
        url: &quot;/get_data?country=&quot; + encodeURI(params.label)
        success: function (data) {
            // Update the component with new data
            done(); // now finish the drill down
        }
    })
});
</code></pre><p>Notice how the <code>done</code> function can be called inside the AJAX success function</p>

<p>For example, while filtering cities, you might need to perform a query which also knows the country and state. In other words, you need to know the entire history of the drilldown. For this, the <code>params</code> object includes a separate key called <code>drillLabelList</code>. </p>
<p>chart.addDrillStep (function (done, params) {
    alert (&quot;Filtering states for state: &quot; + params.label);
    alert (&quot;The country is: &quot; + params.drillLabelList [0]); // drillLabelList is now [&quot;Country&quot;, &quot;State&quot;]
    chart.setLabels ([ /<em> List of cities in the selected state </em>/])
    chart.addSeries (&quot;sales&quot;, &quot;Sales&quot;, [ /<em> city-wise sales </em>/])</p>
<pre><code>done (); // This is required
</code></pre><p>});</p>
